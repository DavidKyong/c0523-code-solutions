## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
A function takes the codes and does tasks for the value to come up. There are times where you could input a argument and there will be an output depending on what the code is.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
The function word, followed up with a name for it, followed up with parentheses zero or more parameters, followed up with your code block, followed up with a return statement.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
They are called with the parentheses next to the function name
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
Calling a function causes the code in the code block to run while a definition does not.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
The parameter is basically a like a placeholder. When there is a value, that value will call the function. This is an argument.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
It helps you by not having to rewrite the same code over and over to get the result.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program. And it prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
